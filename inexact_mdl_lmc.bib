  Abstract                 = {Determining the number of clusters is a crucial problem in cluster analysis. Cluster validity measures are one way to try to find the optimum number of clusters, especially for prototype-based clustering. However, no validity measure turns out to work well in all cases. In this paper, we propose an approach to determine the number of cluster based on the minimum description length principle which does not need high computational costs and is also applicable in the context of fuzzy clustering.},

  Abstract                 = {As a prolific research area in data mining, subspace clustering and related problems induced a vast quantity of proposed solutions. However, many publications compare a new proposition—if at all—with one or two competitors, or even with a so-called "naïve" ad hoc solution, but fail to clarify the exact problem definition. As a consequence, even if two solutions are thoroughly compared experimentally, it will often remain unclear whether both solutions tackle the same problem or, if they do, whether they agree in certain tacit assumptions and how such assumptions may influence the outcome of an algorithm. In this survey, we try to clarify: (i) the different problem definitions related to subspace clustering in general; (ii) the specific difficulties encountered in this field of research; (iii) the varying assumptions, heuristics, and intuitions forming the basis of different approaches; and (iv) how several prominent solutions tackle different problems.},
