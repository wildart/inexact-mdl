We present a regularization technique based on the minimum description length
(MDL) principle for the linear manifold clustering. We suggest an inexact minimum
description length method based on describing the data structure as
linear manifold clusters.
We examine the behavior of the proposed method and compare it performance
against simulated clustering results of various dimensionality and structure.
Finally, we empirically evaluate the proposed technique on a climate data.
